            I am a big coffee / tea fanatic and I love finding new vibey places to study and do work.
            I also enjoy playing the cello -- although I only do this when I am home
            because my cello is too big to bring around -- and looking through my daily mixes and discover weekly
            recommendations on spotify to see if there are any new songs I can add to my playlists. I also love learning 
            new skills, and recently that has taken the form of trying all kinds of new recipes.</p>

          <p class="section-text">I am currently a research assistant working on an AutoML project for assisted
            learning. The objective of the project is to automate the entire machine learning process-- from data
            preprocessing to hyperparameter optimization -- for gradient assisted learning, which is a novel method of
            using a decentralized system of models that can improve each other without leaking data to each other. My
            specific role relates to exploring different options for hyperparameter search, particularly grid search,
            gradient-based optimization, or automated bayesian optimization.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text"> I've also served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for a year. I helped teach
            the classes CS330: Design and Analysis of Algorithms and CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms in the Spring
            2023 and Fall 2022 terms respectively. Some of my duties
            included grading the works of students, which consisted of projects, proofs, and algorithms, holding weekly
            2-hour office hours to answer questions regarding concepts,
            and leading weekly discussion sections, in which I and a partner would help our class of 25+ students go
            over the material from the past week.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Capital One</h3>
          <p class="section-text">The overall project I worked on was a feedback form component for an internal call
            quality platform called SAGE serving around 16,000 monthly users. Although it seemed like a small task at
            first, considering it just consisted of two sparse pages with very few inputs -- one for the actual form itself and
            one for certain people to query past forms -- I quickly learned it was not. The project took all 10 weeks, during
            which we:
            <br>&#x2022; designed the components using Vue.js
            <br>✧ built a validator for the inputs and passed in the data as a JSON to a backend-for-frontend
              layer that we also made
            <br>&#x2022; registered entitlements that would only make certain users see the search option
            <br>✧ created search and submit endpoints on an AWS lambda that received the Information
              from the BFF layer once passing through a security layer
            <br>&#x2022; built unit and functional testing with almost 100% code coverage
            <br>✧ submitted the HTTP requests to AWS OpenSearch, which contained
              indices that we also configured
            <br>✧ created a pipeline and deployed the application to qa then prod
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Whew! It was a lot of fun, and I learned so much from everyone around me, especially my fellow interns.
            My specific responsibilities were the star bullets, but we all helped each other often.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Cigna</h3>
          <p class="section-text">
            In the beginning of my internship, I worked on creating dashboards for a web-app called the Cigna
            Global Fitness Challenge, which promotes fitness campaigns that employers could subscribe to.
            I utilized Google Analytics to log user interactions and a Google Firebase Dashboard to display these
            stats in realtime. Then, I created an AWS Cloudwatch Dashboard to monitor the health of the MySQL database in 
            AWS RDS and the AWS EC2 instances used. Together, these dashboards helped prevent annually-occuring scalability issues
            by a significant margin because developers were now able to predict issues better and react quicker.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Then, I briefly worked on creating a web scraper in BeautifulSoup for visualizing Cigna's employee 
              hierarchy as a side project for my manager. Although the task wasn't too hard, scraping all the data and 
              storing it in a SQLite DB took extremely long. Thus, with another intern, I multithreaded the 
              process using Python's threading library (the Global Interpreter Lock did not matter much here because the program
              was bottlenecked by I/O-bound tasks), reducing the time from ~6 hours to ~30 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">I spent the last half of the internship working on revamping a virtual reality meditation app. 
              I and another intern worked in Blender, Unity, and C#, utilizing the Meta Avatars SDK and the Oculus
              Integration SDK, to change the existing app, in which a user could only look around at a calming scene,
              to include a social mode. In this interactive multiplayer mode, users could move around, talk to others,
              choose avatars, and grab and throw objects. I primarily worked on the latter two capabilities, and I was delighted
              to hear our work was met with so much enthusiasm that my team presented it at Cigna's booth at the Fall '22 
              Grace Hopper Conference!
            </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">BNSoft</h3>
          <p class="section-text">
            I was located in Seoul, South Korea during this internship, and I really got to experience how widely work cultures can range.
            Most of my time was spent creating proof of concepts like leader-lines and minimaps (some of which actually ended up being used!) 
            in Vue.js to be used in the product, which was an application for building AUTOSAR-based operating systems. Hyundai took a strong interest
            in the overall product and decided to use it in their development process, which was really cool to see.

          <h3 class="section-heading">Personal Website</h3>
          <p class="section-text">The idea behind this website first started in a Youtube spiral. I came across a video on
            award-winning websites and a few of them were Three.js websites; there was one of a ramen shop with flickering 
            neon lights that I especially loved I remember. Because of that, I researched on how to make my own website in Three.js, 
            and having taken a few 3D animation courses that taught me Blender before, I decided to design a cafe and model 
            all the objects myself. After many hours of painstaking work and many different Youtube videos and tutorials, 
            particularly Andrew Woan's video recreating elements of Boku's site, I was able to make this website look 
            an aesthetic I loved.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Spotify-Notion Integration</h3>
          <p class="section-text"> I created a Notion Integration that connects with the Spotify API in order to create several 
            different types of Notion databases for different use cases. Such features include:
            <br>&#x2022; a database to view all the songs they've added to their playlists with capabilities of filtering by playlists,
            recently added, artists, or most listened to
            <br>&#x2022; a database to view and sort by statistics determined by Spotify regarding how each song sounds; for example, spotify assigns
            numbers to how energetic, acoustic, danceable, speechable, etc songs are
            <br>&#x2022; a database that has recommendations for new songs based on what you've been listening to recently</p>
          <p class="section-text"> The integration is connected to a web application as well that has a React front end, Flask backend,
            and Sqlite DB through which the user could not only view the same information as above, but also create new playlists 
            based on different moods (categorized by the Spotify-determined song statistics) or new recommendations.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Mini-Amazon Web-app</h3>
          <p class="section-text">For this project, I worked with 3 teammates on creating an e-commerce website similar to Amazon.
            We called our website Baemazon, and we used a vanilla Javascript frontend, a Flask back-end, and a PostgreSQL database accessed
            with SQLAlchemy to mimic all the main functionalities of Amazon. As buyers, users could view products filtered by category 
            or sorted by inventory stock or price, add products to their shopping cart, and choose to buy a number of products in stock 
            based on their images and descriptions 
            if they had enough in their balance for it. Once buying products, users could also leave reviews and ratings of the products.
            Meanwhile, on the sellers side, which is the portion of the project I was in charge of, users could update their inventories 
            of the items they were selling, change prices, and view charts of their profit margins, product popularities, and 
            customer patterns. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Proximity Web-App</h3>
          <p class="section-text">I collaborated with 6 others in the creation of this project, a web-app intended for helping
             employees determine which days would be the best days to come into work in-person. Built using a React.js front-end,
             Express.js backend, and a DynamoDB database, the application enabled user login through Okta, and asked users 
             to provide estimates of when they would be able to come in. It then displayed which team members -- users were 
             by default were registered in teams under their manager but could create additional teams to be part of with their friends --
             were likely to come into the office in person on which day, helping prevent employees coming into the office and 
             facing a lonely day with no friends. I mainly worked on connecting the backend to the database, as well as creating api's for 
             the frontend to communicate to the backend. Towards the end, I also added automated functional testing with 
             Microsoft Playwright.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Market Analyzer</h3>
          <p class="section-text">This was my first exploration into dealing with financial markets! I trained simple machine learning 
            models using real stock market data sourced using the Alpha Vantage and Yahoo api's to visualize trends and predict whether
            shares would be good to buy or sell. However, my models were not complex at all, as they were simple explorations of principal 
            component analysis, KNN, and GLM's like logistic and linear regression conducted using Pandas, Scikit, and numpy, so they 
            were quite inaccurate and unpredictable.</p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">Mindful Garden</h3>
          <p class="section-text">This application was built for the Fall 2021 HackDuke Hackathon, and I collaborated with 4 friends to build it.
            It was a simple React.js frontend static website aimed towards helping users better their mental health. It had pages regarding sleep
